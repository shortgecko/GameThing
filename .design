Game design:
First, what do I think is good game design: Good game design is things that make a game fun, 
derek yu, creator of spelunky says: "Way harder and also more important to figure out how to 
get players excited about a game than how to "balance" a game, even though the latter sounds 
more designer-y. Balancing a game too early is like painting with small brushes too early."
