player - move horiz. and can wall jump to an unlimite degree (super meat boy style, not celeste)
spring - its a spring, 4 dir up right left down
falling block - falls down when touched by player, doesnt matter where it is

entity ideas
elevators (goes up or down, but you have to trigger the event that does that and wait a bit) (elevator functions more as trigger lift)

level ideas
level 1 -4 falling blcoks / springs, get used to movement
then you get 4 elevator centric leveles
