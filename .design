Engine design:

Game design:
First, what do I think is good game design: Good game design is things that make a game fun, 
derek yu, creator of spelunky says: "Way harder and also more important to figure out how to 
get players excited about a game than how to "balance" a game, even though the latter sounds 
more designer-y. Balancing a game too early is like painting with small brushes too early."

Genre: Shoot um up
Player: Can shoot two bullets at a time, no guns witching, but they are limited time powerups

Enemy Ideas:
	-"Suicide Bomber"(make sure to change name) enemy does little damage and can be killed easily
	however, when killed it causes a massive explosion which does a lot of damage


Engine Design:
The engine must accomadate the game, at this point the engine has an animation system, a 
state machine, an entity component system, and other things (these things are important, but 
dont really help make the game any better, it's jsut boilerplate engine code, like an input system
and so on.)

Engine needs (based on game):
particle system
audio system (maybe look into using FMOD)
