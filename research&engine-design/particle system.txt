Particles are essentially jsut a binch fo sprites mving randomly,

Degin:
the particle class should just hold the data of every particle, it shouldn't set the data

particle ->
{
 position,
 rotation,
 velcoity
 scale???
 angle
 angular velcotiy
 texture
}

particle system ->
{
 creates particles and sets postion and other data for the particles
 heavily rng based, is classified as a game component.
}


additions ->
{
 different shapes for particles,
 different colors (this would be hard, as doing a randomly ngenerated color is hard
 its not a number, and thered have to be a color list/pool generated by the user, 
 and on the low chance that i find any use for it in the game, i dont't think it's worth
using it,
however i do think maybe being able to randomly manipulate thr rgb values of a particles might 
be cool)
